                        My name is Bilal Saeed, I began my programming carrier in 2018 with a background in Business Administration and an emphasis in Finance in Marketing. 
                        I have over 12 years of expereince in Operations Management in the healthcare industry. The world of coding has always been a long awaited journey that I have
                        been wanting to fulfil. This will be a milestone in my career to acheive success and become a full stack coder.

                        I plan to learn all of the standards, techniques, and the various frameworks in the industry to become an expert-level coder
                        and manage existing IT projects in a much more efficient manner. By employing a higher level of expertise in coding field will allow
                        an increased intuition and familiarize myself better with advanced programmers in the industry.

                        success and apply my learned skills in my daily coding life.
